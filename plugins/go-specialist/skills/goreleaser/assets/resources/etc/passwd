# Minimal passwd file for scratch-based Docker containers
# Required for USER directive to work in Dockerfile
#
# Format: username:password:UID:GID:comment:home:shell
#
# CUSTOMIZE: Replace PROJECT_USER with your application's username
#   - Must match USER directive in Dockerfile
#   - UID/GID 1000:1000 is standard for non-root containers
#   - Password field 'x' indicates shadowed password (not used in scratch images)
#   - Home directory '/' since scratch has minimal filesystem
#   - No shell specified (last field empty) since scratch has no shell
#
# Security best practices:
#   - Always use non-root user (UID > 0)
#   - UID 1000 is conventional for application users
#   - Avoid UID 0 (root) for security
