# Analyze Pull Request Command

Perform comprehensive analysis of a pull request including code review, security scan, and test coverage.

## Process

1. **Detect Repository Type**: Check git remote for GitHub or GitLab
   ```bash
   git remote -v
   ```

2. **Fetch PR Details**: Use appropriate MCP server
   - GitHub: `mcp__github__pull_request_read` (method: get, get_files, get_diff)
   - GitLab: `mcp__gitlab-mcp__get_merge_request`

3. **Analyze Changes**: Launch 4 parallel Sonnet agents to independently review the pull request:

   **Agent #1: Code Quality Review** (`code-review-enforcer` agent)
   - Review modified files for code quality issues
   - Check for logic errors, error handling, performance issues
   - Verify adherence to coding standards
   - Return: list of issues with severity levels and line numbers

   **Agent #2: Security Analysis** (`security-auditor` agent)
   - Scan for security vulnerabilities in modified files
   - Focus on auth/crypto changes, input validation, SQL injection
   - Check for exposed secrets or sensitive data
   - Return: list of security findings with CVSS-like severity ratings

   **Agent #3: Test Coverage Assessment**
   - Analyze modified files to identify new functionality
   - Check if corresponding tests were added
   - Evaluate test quality and edge case coverage
   - Return: coverage report with missing test scenarios

   **Agent #4: Documentation Validation**
   - Detect if public API or user-facing features changed
   - Verify README.md, API docs, CHANGELOG updated
   - Check for inline code documentation completeness
   - Return: list of missing or outdated documentation

4. **Validate Findings with Haiku Agents**: For each issue found by the 4 agents above, launch a parallel Haiku agent to score confidence (0-100):
   - 0: False positive or pre-existing issue
   - 25: Somewhat confident, might be false positive
   - 50: Moderately confident, real but minor issue
   - 75: Highly confident, real issue impacting functionality
   - 100: Absolutely certain, critical issue

   Filter out issues with confidence score < 80 before including in report.

## Parallel Agent Invocation

Launch agents concurrently using the Task tool:

```
# Fetch PR details first
pr_details = mcp__github__pull_request_read(method: "get", owner: owner, repo: repo, pullNumber: pr_number)
pr_files = mcp__github__pull_request_read(method: "get_files", owner: owner, repo: repo, pullNumber: pr_number)
pr_diff = mcp__github__pull_request_read(method: "get_diff", owner: owner, repo: repo, pullNumber: pr_number)

# Launch 4 parallel Sonnet agents for analysis
Task(subagent_type: "code-review-enforcer", model: "sonnet", prompt: "Review PR #${pr_number} for code quality issues. Modified files: ${pr_files}. Diff: ${pr_diff}. Return findings with severity and line numbers.")

Task(subagent_type: "security-auditor", model: "sonnet", prompt: "Scan PR #${pr_number} for security vulnerabilities. Focus on auth/crypto changes. Files: ${pr_files}. Return security findings with severity.")

Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "sonnet", prompt: "Analyze PR #${pr_number} test coverage. New functionality: ${extract_new_features(pr_diff)}. Verify tests added. Return missing test scenarios.")

Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", model: "sonnet", prompt: "Validate PR #${pr_number} documentation. API changes: ${extract_api_changes(pr_diff)}. Check README/docs updated. Return missing docs.")
```

These agents run independently and results are aggregated in step 5.

5. **Generate Report**: Create structured markdown report with:
   - PR summary (title, description, files changed, commits)
   - Code quality findings (issues, suggestions)
   - Security findings (vulnerabilities, risks)
   - Test coverage analysis
   - Overall recommendation (approve/request changes/comment)

6. **Optional**: Ask user if they want to post review comments to PR

## Output Format

```markdown
